In general:  More useful error messages, not just using ruby exception stack trace.  I.e., not enough args is a common source of this.

init: passes, except does not error if in dir that already has repo in it.

clone: doesn't seem to copy files over? creates .jsaw folder but can't checkout files either.

reproduce:

jsaw init
touch test.txt
echo "hello world!" >> test.txt
jsaw add test.txt
jsaw commit "adding test.txt!" 

Some other dir

jsaw clone [ORIGIN_DIR]


checkout: fails.  could not seem to get it working at all.  Simply make multiple commits with the same file, and trying to checkout gives me:


~/Documents/JSAW/src/jsaw checkout 1

/Users/joshcohen/Documents/JSAW/src/revlog.rb:67:in `base': no implicit conversion from nil to integer (TypeError)


log: passes.

add: passes?  Doesn't have an error message, relies on ruby exception when adding nonexistent file.  Does not indicate if file already added, ends up causing commit to fail , so i don't know if that's a failure on this or commit, likeley this though.

remove: Does not error on nonexistent file.  Does not error on previously removed file.

status: passes

heads: Fails.  Error if no commit has been made yet.
 No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /Users/joshcohen/beta_other/.jsaw/current (Errno::ENOENT)

reproduce:

add "some_non_existant_file" (errors as well)
commit "Some message"


cat: passes

merge, diff: If it is known not to work I don't know if I can really test them
